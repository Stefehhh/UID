<h3>Where are we Located:</h3>

<h4>Pet Shop Direct's office and warehouse are located at Taren Point which is in Southern Sydney about 5 min from Cronulla.

<h3>What is our Goal:</h3>

<h4>Our main goal is to provide good old customer service. Coming from a retail background and helping people with their pets on a daily basis gives us the experience in helping people with the care of their pets. Send us an email, were happy to help where we can.</h4>

<h4>Both management and our staff believe that pets deserve to be treated well and cared for as they are dependent on us to look after them. As most of us know, they can make a valuable contribution to any family, they can pick you up when you're feeling sad, they can give you companionship when you're feeling lonely & they can make you laugh when your upset. Bonding with a pet can be a rewarding experience.</h4>

<h3>From a business perspective, we want to provide:</h3>

<h4>1. A fast delivery service. Most of us wait until the last minute to stock up on our pets food and medications, so we know that getting the goods to our customers quick is very important. We send out same day or next day depending on when an order is placed. We use both Couriers and Australia Post for our deliveries. All with tracking provided.</h4>

<h4>2. Communication. Replying to your emails quick. No one wants to wait 2 days for a reply. We endeavour for fast response to your enquiry. Generally within a few hours.</h4>

<h4>3. Low Prices. Everyone is looking for a deal. Great value and quality products are what we're all about. We only stock quality products from brands that you know and trust. Don't risk your pets health with knock offs and no name brands.</h4>
